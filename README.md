# Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

Welcome to the Disease Prediction project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on patient symptoms and historical data.

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for building and deploying a machine learning model for disease prediction. The model is trained on a dataset containing patient information and corresponding disease diagnoses.

## Features

- Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model.
- Model: Description of the machine learning model used for disease prediction.
- Usage: Instructions on how to use the provided code to train the model and make predictions.
- Results: Summary of the model's performance and evaluation metrics.
- Deployment: Information on deploying the trained model for real-world use.

## Dependencies
